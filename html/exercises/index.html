      <p>I want to make a website that allows you to play music from a playlist wihtout hearing the same song too often. I use Spotify, and one thing I've noticed that bugs me is when I listen to a playlist on shuffle, I hear the same songs repeated often and I will never hear other songs. I would prefer if my playlist looped through all the songs and didn't repeated any songs until it had played through all of them.</p>
